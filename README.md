# Kong Gateway Testing Project

This project demonstrates how to test **Kong Gateway** configurations using **Cypress**.

## Project Structure

- **Main test suite file:**  
  `cypress/e2e/kong-gateway-tests/gateway_configuration.cy.js`

- **Setup:**
  - Add `httpbin` to the Dockerfile as a mock upstream service.
  - Include a database helper and register its operations as Cypress tasks.

## Test Suite Overview

The test suite covers the following scenarios:
1. **Before Test**
   - Clean up previous test data to ensure a fresh environment.

2. **Gateway Configuration:**
   - Add a gateway service and verify the corresponding database entry.
   - Add a route and verify the corresponding database entry.
   - Add a consumer and verify the corresponding database entry.

3. **Route and Plugin Validation:**
   - Add the **Basic Auth** plugin.
   - Add the **Rate Limit** plugin.
   - Test the route without authentication.
   - Test the route exceeding the rate limit.

## Continuous Integration

- **GitHub Actions Integration:**
  - The Cypress test suite runs automatically whenever there is a push to the `main` branch.
  - The **Allure** test report is generated and published to the GitHub Pages for easy access.

## P.S.
Since this is a proof-of-concept project aimed at showcasing automation capabilities, it doesnâ€™t include extensive negative test cases (e.g., boundary value checks). Design patterns such as the Page Object Model are also omitted, as the demo is intentionally kept simple.
